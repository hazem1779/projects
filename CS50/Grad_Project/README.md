Polynomial Equation Solver
Video Demo: https://youtu.be/F8U7p-7xAJw
Description:

The project is about a web application using Flask and its own libraries to create a web framework environment to such a project.
In the application, the user inputs the degree of the polynomial he wants to solve and he also inputs the coefficients of all the X powers in dynamically genrated spaces using JavaScript.
Once the user inputs the degree and the coefficients, the program returns the solution to this equation and give it back to the user whether the solution contains real or imaginary parts.
It's a simple yet fast application for solving Polynomials in a web based application.
I used html, css, javascript and python in this flask application
I downloaded Visual Studio Code to test if I can code on any other IDE rather than CS50 IDE and after one tutorial or two and reading some documentations I was finally able to create my own virutal environment
using flask and i started writing my MVC or model, view and controller by application.py as a controller and a bunch of html files with css styles but i didnt use any database like sql as my project was simple it just prompts the user for inputs and gives output back in a web form design.
After I finished I had some errors and googled them then I solved all of them then I copied my files into the cs50 ide so I can submit my project correctly and then I run it on the ide and it worked just exactly fine.
While making this project, the idea itself when it came to me was pretty easy and obvious but when I tried to make it in a web based form i struggled and faced a lot of problems.
I took the helping hand from google and the various documentatios on it and of course the videos on youtube were absolutly helpful but most importantly I went back to the course videos watched them once and sometimes twice to just figure out what the rong method I was seeking.
This course was my first step in my programming journey and I can gladly say that it was very very helpful and I had a satisfying amount of information about programming languages like C and Python and other differnt things like html, css and sql which I had no basic idea about how they were working.
So I started this project by thinking like three or four years in my college when I firstly was encountered with solving high dgree polynomials and then I was taught in college the rational root theorem and other theorems which used the synthetic division and I took my time to remember those methods using books and videos.
then I searched the internet to find if there is already a library that exists already that can help me with my problem. After some reasearch, I found out that I can use numpy library used specially for these issues.
so, I started looking at the documentation of this library to see how it works. Finally, I figured out how to use it specially for my case.
I started by making a python simple code to test how it works and it worked properly. Then I had to draw for myself how the web page itself should be and how it should prompt the user for a certain degree of polynomial and how it can get the coefficients of this polynomial to solve it properly.
It took time and effort to understand how different methods like GET and POST works so I started learning about http requests.
the I was finnaly able to create a simple form to prompt the user for the degree to his polynomial and then dynamically creat elements using JavaScript codes to ask the user about the coefficients of his polynomial.
Finally, the user will be able easily to see the roots to any polynomial of any degree in his page.
